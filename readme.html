<h2 id="astripped-downstarterwordpressthemefordevelopers.">A stripped-down starter WordPress theme for developers.</h2>

<p>Based on the amazing Bones starter theme by Eddie Machado: http://themble.com/bones.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with Bones, I highly suggest you check it out before using Template. Bones is exquisitely commented and meant to be a learning tool.</p>

<p>I make no Bones (pun definitely intended) about Template copying a lot of what was included in Bones but wanted to customize it for my studio&#8217;s workflow. This may or may not work for you.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I&#8217;ve removed some things I never used in Bones (like Link Pages and tags on pages, amongst others) and added some things in that I use often: more page templates, updated default font stack, a custom post type plugin template, and some custom functions.</p>

<p>Edit this, fork it, change it, delete it - whatever. As Eddie might say: it&#8217;s your world. But I hope you make something cool with it.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> this is a work in progress. There&#8217;s a lot of comments throughout the theme files left over from Bones and I&#8217;m not trying to hide that. They may change or be updated as work on Template progresses.</p>

<h3 id="alittlehistory">A Little History</h3>

<p>My introduction to Bones came four years ago after trying out just about every starter theme out there. Once I found Bones I was hooked and have used it ever since on hundreds of projects. Bones got me to use Sass/SCSS, taught me a ton about WordPress, how themes <em>really</em> work, and made me a better developer.</p>

<p>Yet, over time I found I was making the same changes to Bones at the start of every project and this was taking up valuable time. Thus, I created the predecessor to this theme called &#8216;Osseous&#8217; which included some of the changes found in Template. Osseous literally means: &#8216;of, relating to, or composed of bone&#8217; and was a good departure point.</p>

<p>Template picks up where Osseous left off and takes things a bit further with &#8216;template&#8217;. It includes namespaced functions and customized defaults along with a lot of other stuff I like and use for my development. Your mileage may vary.</p>
