# Template
## A stripped-down starter theme for developers.

Based on the amazing Bones starter theme by Eddie Machado: http://themble.com/bones.

If you're not familiar with Bones, I highly suggest you check it out before using Template. Bones is exquisitely commented and meant to be a learning tool.

I make no Bones (pun definitely intended) about Template copying a lot of what was included in Bones but wanted to customize it for my studio's workflow. This may or may not work for you.

With that in mind, I've removed some things I never used in Bones (like Link Pages and tags on pages) and added some things in that I use often: more page templates, a custom post type plugin template, and some custom functions.

Edit this, fork it, change it, delete it - whatever. As Eddie might say: it's your world. But I hope you make something cool with it.

**Note:** this is a work in progress. There's a lot of comments throughout the theme files left over from Bones and I'm not trying to hide that. They may change or be updated as work on Template progresses.

### A Little History
My introduction to Bones came four years ago after trying out just about every starter theme out there. Once I found Bones I was hooked and have used it ever since on hundreds of projects. Bones got me to use Sass/SCSS, taught me a ton about WordPress, how themes *really* work, and made me a better developer.

Yet, over time I found I was making the same changes to Bones at the start of every project and this was taking up valuable time. Thus, I created the predecessor to this theme called 'Osseous' which included some of the changes found in Template. Osseous literally means: 'of, relating to, or composed of bone' and was a good departure point.

Template picks up where Osseous left off and takes things a bit further. Booyakasha!
